Acey Deucey for Android by Stephen Milone

This game is a variation of the card game Acey Deucey known as Red Dog.  It takes the basic gameplay of Acey Deucey and turns it into a casino game that can be played by a single player. 

This is my 1st game that I created in October 2010.  The coding was done as I was learning the Android SDK and is very basic.  I am hoping that making it public will force me to clean it up and follow more best practices as I'm now a more experienced Android developer then when I was writing this code.

Any questions I can be reached at android@stephenmilone.com
