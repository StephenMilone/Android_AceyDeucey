		The game only uses three cards at a time, which are ranked as in
		poker, with aces high. Suit is irrelevant. A wager is placed, and two
		cards are placed face up on the table, with three possible outcomes:
		\n\n1) If the cards are consecutive in number [Example: 4-5 or
		Jack-Queen], the hand is a push and the player\'s wager is returned.
		No third card is dealt.
		\n2) If the two cards are of equal value, a third card is dealt. If the
		third card is of the same value, then the payout for the player is
		<b>11:1</b>, otherwise the hand is a push.
		\n3) If neither of the above is the case [Example: 3-8], then a spread is
		announced which determines the payoff [A 4-card spread in this
		example], and a third card will be dealt. Before dealing the third
		card, the player has the option to double their bet. If the third
		card\'s value falls between the first two, the player will receive a
		payoff according to the spread; otherwise the bet is lost.
		\n\n<b>Spread : Payout
		\n1-card : 5 to 1
		\n2-card : 4 to 1
		\n3-card : 2 to 1
		\n4-to-11-card : 1 to 1 (even money)</b>
		\n[<i>The above was pulled from Wikipedia</i>]
		\n\nThe player is given an $100 bank roll to start with and can bet anywhere
		from $1 to the max. The game\'s deck consist of 8 standard 52 card
		decks, 416 cards. The hints at the top of screen during gameplay will
		provide insight as to what is going on in the game and your current
		status, which have now been turned on if they were off. The game ends after your bank roll is $0.\n\n\n\n

		Acey Deucey can be played in a variety of ways. This game uses
		the rules of the casino variant of Acey Deucey known as Red Dog.
		\nAcey Deucey is a 3 card game, the player is dealt 2 cards face up
		and wins if the 3rd card\'s value falls between the first two cards.
		\n\n<b>Acey Deucey/Red Dog Differences</b>
		\nAcey Deucey is a game played in a group, with a community pot, you can
		only win as much as you bet and you can only bet what is in the pot,
		however certain outcomes could force you to lose double, even triple
		your bet. Red Dog is a casino variant that can be played solo, it also
		let\'s you bet whatever you have, and you win pay outs based on odds.
		See the Rules and Tutorial section for more info.
		\n\nThe main difference people will notice is that Acey Deucey lets the
		player see the first 2 cards before placing a bet, in Red Dog players
		bet first, but then are given an option to double their bet after
		seeing the 2 cards, because of this in Acey Deucey if a player is
		dealt an unwinnable hand [Ex: 6-7], the player can bet $0 or \'pass\',
		in Red Dog the unwinnable hands are a push.
		\n\nFor a longer reading on the differences, and why a single player variant
		of the standard Acey Deucey is hard to produce, please visit\n
